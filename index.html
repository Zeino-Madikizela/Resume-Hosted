        <p> 
            I am a self-motivated computer science graduate. I am driven, a student, 
            a team player and a leader. Learning and applying the 
            knowledge is something I am seeking greatly. I am well 
            presented and strongly focused on the ability to 
            complete tasks accurately in a fast-paced environment 
            with conflicting deadlines.
